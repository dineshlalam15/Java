Population is a common property for every human.
It's a static variable. Though the object is not created we can still execute it!
Even without referencing to any object.

Main - static method. It's mandatory.
Because it should allow us to run even though if object of that class is not created.
Without main method declaration, we can't run a java code.

In 'Main' class, object.population also gives the correct answer, but it's not the correct way to mention.

Can't use a static method in something that is non-static.
We cannot call a non static function without a reference. We need to have an object!!

We cannot used 'this' keyword in static method. Because, this refers to an obj. In static method how can we
use a non static object?

INNER CLASS
1. Outer classes cannot be static. Inner classes can be static.
2. Inner Classes if present, will be dependent in outer classes.
3. static here refers to that 'Test' class doesn't depend on Inner Class to run.
4. Objects are created during run time.
5. Static variables are initialized when the class is loaded (runtime), before any objects are created.
6. Static inner classes can be accessed directly without creating objects of the outer class.
7. Each class has its own main method, but only the main method in the class being executed will run.
